Welcome to the **InVEST Calibration Assistant**, a tool created to simplify the process of calibrating and validating hydrological and water quality models from the InVEST platform. Whether you're preparing your data for a single watershed or refining simulations across multiple catchments, this guide will walk you through every step to make the journey smooth, structured, and reproducible.

## üåç A Quick Overview

InVEST includes several environmental models, but the Calibration Assistant focuses on helping you configure and calibrate the following four (from version 3.15.1):

- Annual Water Yield (AWY)  
- Seasonal Water Yield (SWY)  
- Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR)  
- Nutrient Delivery Ratio (NDR)  

Before going further: **only one model can be calibrated at a time**. Trying to activate multiple models will trigger an error‚Äîand no, it won‚Äôt explain itself nicely.

## üöÄ Two Ways to Use the Tool

### Option 1: Use the Precompiled `.exe`

No Python? No problem. For users who prefer to avoid setting up programming environments, a ready-to-use executable is included. Just double-click and follow the prompts‚Äîno installation needed.

### Option 2: Run the Python Source Code

For developers and advanced users, the assistant can be executed directly in Python. A Conda environment file is provided to simplify setup.

1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you haven't yet.
2. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
conda env create -f Env_InVEST_Tool.yml
conda activate InVEST_Tool
```

You're now ready to explore or modify the source code as needed.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure: Laying the Foundation

Every good model starts with organized data. Here‚Äôs how to structure your project:

- Create a main directory with all required input data.
- Refer to the `UserData` sheet in the Excel master file to see which files are needed for each model.
- For each model you want to calibrate, create a subfolder using the format: `Basin_Cal_[ModelName]` (e.g., `Basin_Cal_AWY`).
- In each folder, include a shapefile of your sub-watersheds, making sure it contains a field named `ws_id`.

This ID is essential. It links observed values to each sub-watershed during calibration.

---

## üßæ Configuration File: The Control Center

Everything is managed from an Excel workbook. Here's how the sheets work:

### `UserData` Sheet

- Define the names of the required input files (no extensions).
- Fill in only the red-marked cells.
- Use `1` to activate calibration for a model, `0` to skip it.
- Reminder: only one model can be active per run.

### `Params` Sheet

- Set the minimum and maximum range for each parameter.
- To run a fixed-value simulation without calibration, fill in the `Value` column directly.
- After calibration, the assistant will overwrite this column with the optimized values.

### `Obs_Data` Sheet

- Add your observed data for each sub-watershed.
- Double-check that each `ws_id` matches what's in your shapefile.

## üî¨ Selective Calibration Using the Biophysical Table

Sometimes, not all land cover types should be adjusted equally. That‚Äôs where the `Status_` fields in the biophysical table come in.

Each column beginning with `Status_` followed by a parameter name (e.g., `Status_CN`) defines where calibration should apply:

- A value of `1` means the multiplier will be applied.
- A value of `0` leaves the parameter untouched.

This gives you the flexibility to calibrate only the land covers that matter most‚Äîlike agriculture or grasslands‚Äîwhile excluding others like urban zones or water bodies.

## üß™ Included Sample Dataset: Dummy_InVEST.zip

To help you get started, the repository includes a package named `Dummy_InVEST.zip`. This dataset contains:

- Raster files
- A pre-filled biophysical table
- Shapefiles with the required `ws_id` field
- A complete folder structure for each model
- A working Excel configuration file

Use it to explore how everything works, test the tool, or as a base for your own project setup.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Practical Recommendations

- Use the same coordinate system across all shapefiles and raster layers.
- Choose a pixel size appropriate to your watershed size. Large basins = coarser pixels.
- Always close the Excel file before running the tool. An open file can silently block updates, leading to incomplete or lost outputs.

---

## üßº Recalibration & File Management

Each time you run a calibration, results are stored in the `PARAMETERS` and `EVALUATIONS` folders. These files accumulate over time.

Before starting a new calibration for the same model:

- Delete previous output files for that model.
- Failing to do so can mix old and new results, creating misleading outcomes and invalid parameter sets.

---

## üß† Additional Guidance

- **Plan Ahead**: Calibrations can take time. Allocate enough resources.
- **Check Everything**: Input completeness and format correctness are essential.
- **Version Control**: Keep backup copies of your original data and parameters.
- **Model Limits**: The tool is designed to work with the four listed models only.
